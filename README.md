## Overview
The `Codegame Platform` is a Python desktop application to create, distribute, discover, and run `codegames`.

A `codegame` is a [serious game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serious_game) made of levels written in `Litemark`, a lightweight `Markdown` dialect.

A level is typically a hypertext that gratifies intellectual curiosity, with an embedded programming problem to solve.

The person who produces a `codegame` is the `creator`. The one who consumes a `codegame` is the `user`.

The creator can safely insert problems testing specifications in a level. The Codegame Platform evaluates the solution submitted by the user then unlock the next level if the solution is correct.

This project is suitable for:
- teaching programming, algorithms, data structures;
- teaching ethical hacking;
- building a well-articulated chain of puzzles with an exciting story behind it;
- automating [coding interviews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coding_interview);
- fun, and more...

Now, let's build a codegame demo with the Codegame Platform.

## Installation
### For the first time
```bash
$ pip install codegame
```

### Upgrade
```bash
$ pip install codegame --upgrade --upgrade-strategy eager
```

## Codegame creation
The Codegame Platform has a command line interface to create, build and publish codegames.

### Initialization
Change the current working directory to the folder of the new codegame project. Then use the command `init` to initialize the folder.

```bash
$ cd /home/alex/cgame-demo
$ codegame init
```
Now you have a basic codegame project structure.

### Basic codegame structure
This is the root directory of the codegame project:

```bash
cgame-demo/
    assets/ # [1] this is where you store images
    dist/ # [2] folder to keep distribution packages
    source/ # [3] the main folder to store levels !
    CHANGELOG.md # [4] automatically updated
    codegame.json # [5] the config file of the project
    LATEST_RELEASE.md # [6] latest release
    README.md # [7]

```

- `[1]` this is just a convention, you can ignore this folder and put your images somewhere else.
- `[2]` distribution packages are just ZIP archives generated by the Codegame Platform when you issue the command `build`. You won't need to enter this directory since it's managed by the Codegame Platform.
- `[3]` this is where you store the Litemark files that represent the levels of your codegame.
- `[4]` this file is managed by the Codegame Platform.
- `[5]` when you issue the command `init` for the first time, you will be asked to submit some information (author name, github repository...). This information is stored in this config file that you can edit.
- `[6]` when you issue the command `publish`, the content of this file is automatically cut and pasted in CHANGELOG.md.
- `[7]` there are some basic README text in this file that you can edit.

Note: don't forget to add a license file in the root directory of the codegame project.

### Levels for this demo
Let's edit the folder `source`:
```bash
source/
    1.md # level 1
    2.md # level 2
    3.md # level 3
    index.json # we will store levels titles here
```
This is the content of `index.json`:
```bash
[
    "Welcome Dear Stranger !",
    "Time Is Money...",
    "The Year Of The Four Seasons"
]
```

Each level is just a file with Litemark text inside.
You can preview the rendered level with the command `preview`:
```bash
# cd to the root directory of the codegame project
$ cd /home/alex/cgame-demo
# without any argument, this command will open the first level
$ codegame preview
# preview level 3
$ codegame preview 3
```

### Embed a problem in a level
The Codegame Platform introduces a new level to the user when they complete the problem defined in the previous level.
To insert a problem into a level, all you need to do is insert the test specifications to evaluate the solution in a special codeblock called `codegame-test`. The Codegame Platform will insert a **SOLVE ME !** Button at the bottom of the level page. If the user clicks on the button, they will be prompted to submit a solution in an editor that will open. If the solution passes the tests, a **NEXT LEVEL** button will be inserted at the bottom of the level page.

Let's explore the content of the 3 levels in this codegame demo project.
